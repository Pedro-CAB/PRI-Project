# Steam Games Information System
This project is being developed in the Information Processing and Retrieval course, at the first year of the Masters Degree in Computer Engineering and Informatics at FEUP, in the year of 2023. We are developing a system that contains information about games for sale on Steam based on datasets about those games and user reviews on them.
