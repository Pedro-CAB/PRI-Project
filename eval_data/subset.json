    "price": 7.99,
    "about_info": "'Wait' is a mystery horror game, inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft and the Silent Hill series. The gameplay is put together by elements of exploration and riddle solving. We want to offer a different kind of horror. A horror without jump scares or fighting monsters, but with the fear of the unknown and unimaginable. What is 'Wait'? The game is all about atmosphere and we wanted to support that by giving the player the opportunity to interact with almost every object at different times during the game. It's about exploration and discovering what is happening around you. Everything in 'Wait' is experienced by a young man, the player knows nothing about. And it's intended to be that way. You are literally thrown into another mans life and you can find out more about who that man is, by exploring. His behaviour, his characteristics are slowly revealed through interacting with objects or continuing with the story. 'Wait' may be inspired by the Cthulhu mythos created by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, but doesn't actually take place in it. There are some references here and there, but what was most important to us was the feeling and the atmosphere Lovecraft created in his stories - the fear of the unimaginable. About the project We originally created 'Wait' for the 2014 Indie Game Maker Contest. It was a contest in which you had 4 weeks to create a game, using any official engine. Since the contest was hosted by the RPG Maker Team we decided to go with their engine. Although the engine was made for roleplaying games, we saw potential for an adventurous horror game. During development we grew fond of our little project and once the contest was over we didn't want to let go. There was still so much we wanted to implement, but due to the time limit of 4 weeks we could only do about half of it. That's when we decided to do an extended version to 'really' finish the game, add more details, enhance some visuals, erase plot holes and add some more story content. But that's all just supplementary. 'Wait - Extended' has the following features: Features: Atmospheric exploration gameplay Alternative endings Dynamic replayability (Successive playthroughs will not be same) Achievement system Hidden storylines We hope you will have as much fun with 'Wait', as we have working on it. Every feedback is much appreciated. Our website: /",

On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing. The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project. A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted. Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse? Someone who was supposed to be there isn\u2019t. Someone who wasn\u2019t supposed to be there is. Someone who was alive last night is dead now. And someone who is here right now isn\u2019t alive. So, there is no way to avert tragedy.

    "about_info": "Naval Action is a hardcore, realistic, and beautifully detailed naval combat game immersing players into the experience of the most beautiful period of naval history - when sailing ships ruled the seas. No game has come closer to the replication of the Age of Sail sailing mechanics and combat. Naval action was named one of the best releases from early access in 2019 by Steam and Steam community. Here is what you can expect: Beautiful ships \u2013 We have been painstakingly recreating the beautiful ships of the Age of sail period. Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed trials were used in the creation of vessels. The game features 50+ ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates allowing the player to experience every possible role of that era. Conquest and PVP Activities Fight on War Server \u2013 Fight for the domination of the West Indies, recreated based on 18th Century maps and navigational charts. Build ships, trade, attack enemies of your nation almost everywhere and capture their ships. Open trading outposts and levy taxes in the ports governed by your clan. Invest to turn your controlled ports into industrial hubs, shipbuilding arsenals or fortified harbours. Invite other clans of your nation into your alliance. Built for PVP Age of sail combat is a personal affair with no dirty tricks, corner camping, or hiding in bushes: you see the enemy from 20km and so do they. Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots. Absolutely no hackers. Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes. Yes - you have heard it right: there is a special server that calculates and replicates waves to all users in battle. When fighting in Naval action you can be sure you are only facing skills and ship fittings. Other activities Relax on Peace Server - All nations are at peace and players cannot attack each other in Peace servers. There are no port battles and conquest, piracy or privateering. All ships can be captured from the NPCs. Peace servers are perfect for friendly peaceful gameplay. Tutorials \u2013 In-game tutorials and exams help you to grasp the basics and the subtleties of gunnery and maneuvering. Passing the final naval combat exam grants you the rank of Master and Commander, together with a frigate and other rewards to start your adventures in the West Indies. Admiralty missions \u2013 Accomplish missions for your Admiralty to earn doubloons, combat medals and reward chests. Deliver cargo or passengers, hunt specific ships, join patrol zones battles and sink as many ships as you can. Trading and privateering \u2013 Buy trading goods at low prices, haul them to distant places for high profits. Board ships and sell them and their cargo at nearby ports. Use shallow waters at your advantage to escape from larger ships. Shipbuilding and manufacturing - Build ships, upgrades and cannons, supply your clans or your nation or set up shops in free towns to sell to your enemies. Features Realistic sailing \u2013 Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of ship\u2019s performance in the age of sail. Yard angles, ship angle to wind, fittings and ship condition affects speeds and turning rates. Correct tacking, boxhauling, clubhauling and other elements of realistic sailing will help you win battles in most adverse conditions. Gunnery and weapons \u2013 Major types of naval artillery are implemented: from long guns to mortars to carronades and obusiers. Fort and land batteries will provide you with support during battles near shores. Mortar vessels can destroy fortifications, though they may require an escort. Each gun has realistic ballistics and penetration performance based on historical gun charts and admiralty tests.. Heel and wind affects the shooting distance and will require a change in tactics. Damage model \u2013 Every cannonball is tracked in the air and after it hits the target. Leaks, structural damage, torn sails, demasting, raking, fires, explosions and all other hazards that were possible in that era. Damage is positional: hit the gun and you might destroy it. Gunnery crews are placed deck by deck. Shot can pass through the balcony, ricochet of the gun, hit a crew member and then fly out of the gunport splashing into the water. Armor thickness and wood types affect strength of the hull and cannonballs will ricochet from the hulls at extreme angles. Customization \u2013 Choose economy and battle perks as you progress through higher ranks. Find knowledge books in enemy vessels and build upgrades to improve the performance of your ship. Loot or craft the shipbuilding woods that fit the characteristics you want to give to your future ship. Woods used for crafting of upgrades and equipment",

    "about_info": "Experience the horrors of a haunting that's never the same twice. Paranormal is a 3D fully dynamic haunting experience. The player takes the role of Mattel Clarke, an artist who has a haunted house. Mattel decides to film the hauntings with his camera, which is the viewpoint of the game.The player controls the camera as the hauntings slowly but surely escalate into something far worse and more horrific. With multiple endings, a different experience every time, top-notch graphics and sound, Paranormal is a constantly evolving indie horror game. Features Dynamic Haunting: I've designed the dynamic haunting system that will allow a randomized experience, adding multiple outcomes, dynamic triggers, countless variables, and an action-reaction system. This will make your experience with the game much more unique and memorable, without missing out on anything important. Free Content Updates: Paranormal will receive free content updates that add new locations, stories, scenarios, scares, gameplay mechanics, and more! You will NEVER have to pay for DLC in Paranormal. The game's content is planned to double or even triple with each major content update. Sleep System: Sleeping in your bed recharges your camera's batteries and also has a chance of triggering other events. Flashlight (camera light): Creates a bright, short ranged light that casts dynamic shadows. Insane Sound Design: Paranormal was designed for surround sound and headphones to create the ultimate audio horror experience. First-Person Camera (Found-footage style): Much like in the movies 'Paranormal Activity' or 'The Blair Witch Project' (Not associated with those films, just inspired by them), the viewpoint will be that of a camera being held by a person (the player). Effects like camera shake, pixelation, video distortion, audio distortion, and motion blur will all be present thanks to the camera screen-space shader I built for everything. Horrific Story: Uncover the house's troubled and gruesome past through hauntings, journal entries from the previous owner, and more. Steam Trading Cards: Because one can never have enough of those things! Mac Version: A Mac version is available and will receive updates alongside the PC version. Planned Future Features Achievements: Steam Achievements are planned for the game and there will be plenty to chase after! Full Controller Support: Work has already started on making the game fully gamepad-compatible. VR Support: Paranormal will receive Virtual Reality support, free to owners of the game.

    "about_info": "The Dope Game is a take on John E. Dell's 1984 classic game Drugwars, where the player goes around New York City trying to make as much money as possible selling drugs while evading the police. But this isn't New York City. Or 1984. The Dope Game takes place in the fictional city of Starkham, Blannington; a staple in the CoaguCo universe. To escape the city of Starkham and start your new life, you get your friend Preston to set up a meeting with the local loanshark, Sweaty Mike. After foolishly borrowing $2,000, you embark on a timed mission to sell as many illicit substances as possible throughout the city. However, you must evade the police, make sure not to enrage the locals, and navigate an ever-changing drug market. Visit locations like Crockfort, Pinky's Gun Emporium, Murphy's Lake, The Noose &amp; Rafter Bar, Hillside, Saint Jaysus Memorial Hospital, and more to interact with people and trade in a variety of drugs. Almost everyone you meet can be fought or bartered with in some manner. The newly remastered game features original music by Macabre Gandhi and fully hand-drawn art assets by GP Garcia. For those of you unfamiliar with the premise, here is a fancy list of game features: 18 locations around Starkham 16 different drugs to buy and sell Sell your organs, or someone else's, for fun and profit 35+ barely different weapons and 10 fancy armors 8 different game lengths to play A drop/find system for drugs, money, armor, and weapons with other players Hire randomly-generated crew members to fight with you, including animals Full soundtrack by Macabre Gandhi 30 Achievements Fully hand-drawn game assets Holiday, SFW, and hard modes",

    "about_info": "THE MOST ADVANCED SPACE COMBAT CAPITAL SHIP SIMULATOR. EVER. SERIOUSLY. In Feb 2015, as part of the Battlecruiser twenty-five year anniversary celebration, a refresh of Universal Combat v2.0 was released for FREE for a limited time. Universal Combat which was first released in 2004, was the spiritual successor to the legendary Battlecruiser 3000AD series of games which made its debut in 1996. Then heralded as the most advanced capital ship space combat game, Battlecruiser 3000AD, the first title in the series, set the resulting standard for high-end capital ship combat games. You not only had control over a massive armed carrier in a vast universe with space and planetary bodies, you also had complete control over the carrier\u2019s systems (weapons, navigation etc), support crafts (fighters, shuttles, vehicles) as well as an entire crew that moved around the ship doing various things (e.g. engaging in combat with intruders). When Universal Combat arrived, aside from new graphics technologies, it brought along with it a host of new features which were not present in the previous Battlecruiser titles. Such features included advanced fps controls which allowed you to not only deploy your carrier crew to planets, control them in combat etc, but it also allowed you to fight alongside them In 2007, Universal Combat Collectors Edition was released as the final title in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat IPs. In 2009, following the 2008 release of Galactic Command Echo Squad SE which had improved space and planetary engines, we again refreshed the Universal Combat CE game with those improved engines, then later released it as Universal Combat Collector\u2019s Edition v2.0. This ultimate space capital ship combat compendium spans over two decades and represents the evolution of hard core space combat sims. It contains all Commander scenarios from every game in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat series: Universal Combat Special Edition (3000AD, Oct 2006) Universal Combat A World Apart (3000AD, Oct 2005) Universal Combat Gold (3000AD, Oct 2005) Universal Combat (Dreamcatcher Interactive, Feb 2004) Battlecruiser Millennium Gold (Dreamcatcher Interactive, March 2003) Battlecruiser Millennium (EB Games Exclusive, Nov 2001) Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0 (Interplay, Dec 1998) Battlecruiser 3000AD (Take2, Sept. 1996) PRIMARY GAMEPLAY FEATURES Here is a sampling of the game features, out of hundreds of things that you can do in the game; most of which you can must make up as you go along. And this list doesn't contain any mention of the advanced game engine technologies, especially one of the most advanced AI systems you've ever encountered in a game. Command 28 capital ships including carriers, cruisers, transports. Command 46 support crafts including fighters, shuttles and planetary vehicles. Command a crew of over 100 personnel including key personnel such a Flight Officer, Navigation Officer etc. Use fleet command &amp; control to create a massive fleet consisting of your ships and other AI controlled ones. Direct control of various ship systems including shields, reactor, engine, cloaking, tractor beam, transporters and various advanced weapon systems. Track your ship's AI crew as they go about their on-board duties which include engaging hostile intruders, repairing ship systems, prepping support craft etc. Lead your marines into battle on planets using various weapons of mass destruction. Deploy an away team of (e.g. marines, engineers etc) in a shuttle, deploy them on various planetside missions; complete with advanced orders. Deploy probes to keep track of friendly regions as well as spy on hostile ones. Deploy mining drones on planets to mine for precious minerals which you can then sell for profit. Dock at various space stations and planetary bases to trade, repair, rearm - and of course engage the hostile ones along the way. Capture space stations for your alliance and use them as operational bases, including the ability to use their own fleet of support craft (cruisers, carriers, fighters etc) Play the freeform scenario and roam a large persistent galaxy . No shuttles? Don't want to risk being shot down? Use the transporter room to deploy your combat away team directly into hostile planets. MULTIPLAYER There is no multiplayer in this version of the game. SUPPORT There are no more updates to the base game. The final version was v2.00.03 released on 05-28-2015. You can view the 2.0 changelog for more info. Due to the game being improved upon, future updates are only released via The Lyrius Conflict DLC which uses v3.x game engine kernel. You can view the 3.0 changelog for more info.",

    "about_info": "It's 1972 and a military coup has rocked Anchuria, a small country in Latin America. As a result, you, Angela Burnes, US citizen, are trapped in the metropolitan capital of San Bav\u00f3n. Your paradise has turned into a warzone. To make ends meet, you take up a job as a housekeeper. Every week, an hour before sunset, you clean the swanky bachelor pad of the wealthy Gabriel Ortega. You are given a number of tasks to do, but the temptation to go through his stuff is irresistible. And what is he up to? As you get to know your mysterious absent employer better, you are sucked into a rebellious plot against the notorious dictator who rules the country with an iron fist. \u201cSunset uses the routine of labour to exquisite effect as a framework to tell a story about class and political revolution.\u201d \u2013 Simon Parkin, Eurogamer \u201cSunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles not often explored in this medium.\u201d \u2013 Game Spot, Josiah Renaudin \u201cSunset is a wonderfully atmospheric slow burner and a valuable addition to a medium where the predominant approach to conflict is to just give you a big old gun and invite you to get stuck in.\u201d \u2013 Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun \u201cThe story is excellent and will draw you in, making you feel as if you truly are Angela Burnes.\u201d \u2013 Jessica Mock, Hardcore Gamer \u201cRather than focus on the explicit violence of a military coup, Sunset centers on the emotional brutality of war.\u201d \u2013 Reid McCarter, Playboy Sunset is a narrative-driven first-person exploration game that centers on the discovery of clues to a story that takes place as you play. Sunset is in part inspired by action games set in a war-like context, like many first-person shooters. What life would be like for the NPCs in such games? How does it feel when war is the backdrop for your day-to-day life? Sunset is divided into 44 play sessions that each take a fictional hour: until the sun sets. Each time you get a list of tasks that you are requested to do. But there is more to do in the apartment than just work. There are other activities, such as going through the owner's possessions in search of information, and interacting with his 1970s-era technological gadgets. Angela Burnes, is not an empty vessel. She has a personality of her own and you discover her thoughts while playing. As a US citizen at the end of the sixties, she is inspired by the Black Power and civil rights movements. In an effort to learn more about egality, she travels to the then socialist republic of Anchuria. During her visit, a US-backed military coup happens and she is disallowed from leaving the country. Her university degree is not recognized by the new regime and she is forced to work as a housekeeper to sustain herself. Angela's younger brother, David, who had followed her to Anchuria ends up joining an underground resistance movement. And Angela must worry about what happens to him when the war begins in earnest. Gabriel Ortega is a lover of the arts. Through his work as a curator he met Maria Luisa of the wealthy Veleta family. Thanks to the money from their families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup happened, theaters and museums were closed. The new government offered affluent citizens safety and positions of power. Gabriel's wife, and most of her family and their friends, were happy to accept but Gabriel refused. Rising tensions between the couple ultimately lead to a separation. The story of Sunset begins when Gabriel Ortega moves into a new penthouse apartment in the capital city of San Bav\u00f3n. It is in this apartment that Angela Burnes finds employment. first-person exploration with familiar controls (WASD + mouselook), or customize for your comfort atmospheric: cool 1972 style, reflections, sunset glow, stillness, tension of war, time passing influence the relationship between the two protagonists, emotional narrative arc happens as you play suspenseful story-driven gameplay: interact to explore the fiction responsive environment (light switches, record players, electronic gadgets, etc.) no fail state \u2013 this isn\u2019t a game you can win or lose, only influence anywhere from 90 minutes to 22 hours of gameplay, depending on your approach soundtrack by the award-winning Austin Wintory (Journey, The Banner Saga, Monaco) retro early 1970s style explosions!

    "about_info": "Anomalies may be a game, then again it may not. One user described it as 'A million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain.' Another said 'I don't even know what to say about this one. It honestly freaked me out a little.' A particularly enthusiastic user stated 'Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the universe.' A Fine Art Game Anomalies is an experimental generative art game. There are no levels, points or objectives. It is a 'game' in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can tinker around with and explore. Generate and Explore You can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can change the anomaly's parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your creation. Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique sights and sounds they generate. Sights and Sounds Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and 'songs' you hear in the demo video were produced through the program's algorithms. Other Options Using a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your handiwork. Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you want to revisit a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again later. There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show. Experimental I call Anomalies 'experimental' because of the way in which I developed it. I started with a simple idea - 'what would trees look like if they grew in space?' - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures. Once that was working, I thought about different colors and textures. Each stage brought new questions and possibilities - 'what if they move or wiggle? What it they make sounds? What if they produce flames or particles?' - and so on, until I arrived at what you see in the program. So I had no idea what it would end up like when I started it. Though I have moved on to other projects, I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies. I do hope to be able to return to working on this program at some point, but I will not give any promises right now...",

    "about_info": "OUT NOW - The Real Texas - Part 2, Part 1 - Cellpop Goes Out At Night Texas is launching on Steam with an all-new mini-sequel, Cellpop Goes Out At Night. The sequel is included in the Dusty Skies Edition. Buy them together and save 10%! OVERVIEW 'These days, folks have a lot of funny ideas about what makes a Real Cowboy...' The Real Texas is an action adventure game that plays like a mashup of Zelda: Link to the Past and Ultima VI. Sam, an ordinary Texas rancher, is on holiday in England when he steps through a blue portal and into a purgatory dimension, Strange: Here, a friendly witch is handing out guns to visitors. A crazed, German-speaking wizard hurls elecbolts from his castle. And upriver, something's going on that involves a lot of chickens. Stuck in the middle sits Sam, a Real Cowboy. ... But that's just his job title back home-- it's not obvious that it's of any practical help here! USER REVIEWS The game has been out for awhile-- here's some reviews from other sites: 'This thing is like some bizarre voxel dream, with its square, swaggerin' cowboys and its castles and insane German wizard-scientists and talking rats . . . It's fun and beautiful and a little bit rough on purpose, and I suppose I'll never forget it.' - Abram03 'i will never forget this surreal nostalgic ride. i haven't had such a rewarding experience in a long time.' - countersweet 'This game is incredible and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone.' - Microwave FEATURES Kill things with six types of classic cowboy and fantasy weapons Rummage through peoples' houses without fear of retribution while they go about their daily business Help people out with their PROBLEMS (*rolls eyes*) often by shooting your gun many, many times-- just like real life! Many special items and powerups, optional areas, and two types of chicken cutlets to collect Wear a bullet-proof vest underneath a sequined evening-gown if you want Supports all main game/life perlis including boss battles, enemies, traps, the estate tax IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER NOTES For the Steam release I added achievements, improved the framerate, added more compatibility options, remastered the sound effects and optimized things generally. Even without the mini-sequel it's a lot improved over the original release. But I was careful to NOT ret-conn the original game. People seemed to really like it, so I wanted to respect that by not changing it up in any way. To complete The Real Texas takes maybe about 10 hours, depending on what you want to do. Cellpop Goes Out At Night might take about 1-2 hours. Both the main game and the sequel have lots of secrets and weird things to uncover. In fact, there are some things that still haven't been figured out (to my knowledge) in four years... So I made it an achievement. Ha-ha! Good luck. :) I've put a lot of love into both of these games, and I hope you will find them special and enjoyable. Thanks!",
